## 2024-05-11 - [Bento Flow Accessibility]
**Learning:** High-density modular dashboards (Bento grids) with frequent state updates can be overwhelming for screen readers if not properly managed. Relying purely on visual flow indicators (flashes/flows) excludes non-visual users.
**Action:** Implement ARIA labels that describe both the agent role and its current state (e.g., "Scripting Agent: Working"). Use `motion.button` instead of `motion.div` for tiles to ensure native keyboard focus and "Enter" key support.

## 2024-05-11 - [Contextual Overlays & Focus]
**Learning:** Large overlays in modular dashboards need explicit focus management and keyboard shortcuts (ESC) to avoid trapping users.
**Action:** Added global 'Escape' key listener to the `AgentDetailOverlay` and ensured all modal triggers (Bento Tiles, Minimap dots) are accessible buttons.

## 2024-05-11 - [Thematic Consistency]
**Learning:** Brand identity (Brand Kit) should be deeply integrated into the UX, not just a skin.
**Action:** Implemented a `BrandKit` module that synchronizes colors across "Flow Indicators," "Master Previewer," and "Agent Tiles" to reinforce brand ownership throughout the automated process.

## 2026-05-11 - [Utility Accessibility in Overlays]
**Learning:** For AI-driven output interfaces, utility actions like "Copy to Clipboard" provide high value for external workflows. However, these must be accompanied by explicit focus states and ARIA labels to ensure they don't break the accessibility of the primary modal experience.
**Action:** Implemented a copy feature with visual/haptic feedback and standardized on `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-indigo-400 outline-none` for all overlay interactive elements to support keyboard-first navigation.
